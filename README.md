# SHELL SCRIPTING
- Shell scripting refers to the creation and execution of scripts written in a shell language, typically for automating tasks or performing system administration tasks in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and macOS


 ## Common shell languages include:

 1. Bash (Bourne Again Shell): Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. It is a powerful and feature-rich shell that provides scripting capabilities for automating tasks.

2. sh (Bourne Shell): The Bourne Shell is one of the original Unix shells and is the precursor to Bash. While it lacks some of the advanced features of Bash, it is still widely used in scripting.

3. ksh (Korn Shell): The Korn Shell is an extended version of the Bourne Shell, providing additional features for scripting and interactive use.

4. csh (C Shell): The C Shell is another Unix shell with its own scripting language. While it's not as popular for scripting as Bash or sh, it has its own syntax and features.

## Common tasks performed with shell scripts include

- File manipulation: Creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and directories.
- Text processing: Searching, replacing, and parsing text files.
- System administration: Configuring system settings, managing users and groups, and monitoring system resources.
- Automation: Automating repetitive tasks such as backups, log rotations, and software installations.
- System maintenance: Performing routine maintenance tasks such as disk cleanup, software updates, and system monitoring.
